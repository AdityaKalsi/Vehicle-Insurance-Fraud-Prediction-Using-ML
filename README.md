# Vehicle-Insurance-Fraud-Prediction-Using-ML
I’m thrilled to share the completion of my latest project on vehicle insurance fraud detection using a dataset from Kaggle! Here’s a quick overview of what I did:

1. Data Analysis & Cleaning:

 Conducted a detailed analysis of each column in the dataset to understand its characteristics and identify any issues.
 Cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. Handling Imbalanced Data:

 The dataset was highly imbalanced, which could lead to a biased model.
 Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the data, ensuring the model learns effectively from both majority and minority classes.
 
3. Model Selection:

 Selected LightGBM and XGBoost for their robustness and performance.
 Created a voting classifier combining both models to leverage their strengths.
 
4.Results:

 Achieved an impressive accuracy of 94%! however the highest precision achieved was 47%
